I have a diverse history as a Physician. I completed residencies in Internal Medicine as well as Psychiatry. I also have had significant administrative experience while overseeing the County of Ventura's Behavioral Health Department as the Director for three years. I have run a successful private practice for 8 years as well as working in the public sector.

I am "re-tooling" as a software engineer. Both of my children are in the field and it attracted me as a good way to spend the next 15 to 20 years. As a physician I wrote my own  medical record keeping software and became very interested in computer software development.

To these ends I have spent the last 2+ years procuring software engineering fundamentals such as studying Java, JavaScript, Python as well as networking, database design, computer architecture, operating systems. I pursued my Linux System Administrators certification and was recently awarded a LPIC-1 certification.

My goal is to become a top notch web application software engineer with emphasis on the front end.  I am interested in mastering platforms and frameworks such as React, AngularJS, Rails and Ember. I believe that my extensive experience in the medical field combined with good programming knowledge and skills will afford an opportunity to be synergistically helpful. I see my age as an opportunity to provide diversity and experience to a programming team, especially in the complex area of medical applications.
