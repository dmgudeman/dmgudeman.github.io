In 2002, I embarked on a journey of entrepreneurship and established my private practice. At the time, the search for a reliable electronic medical record for psychiatry bore no fruits. Unfazed, I took the reins and single-handedly developed my own solution. By 2014, I had created an efficient software system based on the Access Database, which allowed me to cater to the needs of 1,200 patients and issue 30,000 prescriptions annually.
A pleasant discovery along this path was the joy I found in writing code. What started as a necessity transformed into a captivating hobby. Following my retirement, I decided to delve deeper into this newfound interest and studied computer science at Foothill College, learning Javascript, Java, Python, Swift, Objective C, databases, and shell scripting. My learning journey continued through Udemy and Coursera, and soon after, I co-founded Crack-a-Packs LLC with a fellow software engineer.
Our maiden project was an application emulating the experience of opening card packs for Magic-the-Gathering. We employed React-Redux and Firebase to bring our idea to life. The three-year period of Covid gave me an opportunity to explore welding, after which I enrolled in the App Academy coding bootcamp. This immersive experience resulted in the creation of three notable projects:
Zelp – a Yelp clone built with Typescript, Reactjs, Redux, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Google Maps. It features a comprehensive search function that allows users to discover businesses based on category, name, or address fragments, offering complete CRUD implementation and user authorization.
Dive The Trieste – an educational app simulating the historic deep-sea dive into the Marianas trench. This interactive tool uses canvas to present the diverse marine life inhabiting six distinct ocean regions. Notably, we implemented an intricate collision detection system and used Typescript to design an efficient state management system, featuring a singleton class design and a publish/subscribe pattern with an event bus for seamless DOM rendering.
Rack Overflow – a Stack Overflow replica that integrates openAI into a MERN stack to create a social platform tailored for fitness enthusiasts with special needs. Posts are categorized to facilitate searching, and the first comment is an AI-generated response providing immediate feedback to users. This full CRUD system with user authorization was a collaborative effort with four other software engineers.
Inspired by the potential of technology in healthcare, my objective is to contribute to the improvement of US healthcare through top-tier software development. My diligence, meticulousness, teamwork, and commitment to task completion are evident from my dual board certification in Psychiatry and Internal Medicine. My former roles as the Director of a County Behavioral Health Department and Medical Director of two inpatient psychiatric units provide me with a wealth of experience. I am excited about new challenges and look forward to exploring how my skills and experience can contribute to your project.
